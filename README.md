#Â Source code for TEPX Beam Induced Background (BIB) timing studies.

The workflow uses data simulated with CMSSW version 11.2.0.pre6. <br>
Simulation outputs are saved in hdf5 files and no ROOT files are involved in the process. <br>
The hdf5 files have the following data structure: <br>

- group: Tof_q <br>
- datasets: dXrY, where X is the TEPX disc ID ((-4)-4) and Y is the TEPX ring ID (1-5) <br>

The hdf5 files together with the standard ROOT simulation outputs are located on lxplus EOS at: <br>
`/eos/cms/store/group/dpg_bril/comm_bril/phase2-sim`
