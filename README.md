#Â Source code for TEPX Beam Induced Background (BIB) timing studies.

The workflow uses data simulated with CMSSW version 11.2.0.pre6.
Simulation outputs are saved in hdf5 files and no ROOT files are involved in the workflow.
the hdf5 files have the following dada structure:
    group: Tof_q
    datasets: dXrY where X is the TEPX disc ID ((-4)-4) and Y is the TEPX ring ID (1-5)
