#Â Source code for TEPX Beam Induced Background (BIB) timing studies.

The workflow uses data simulated with CMSSW version 11.2.0.pre6. <br>
Simulation outputs are saved in hdf5 files and no ROOT files are involved in the process. <br>
The hdf5 files have the following data structure: <br>

- group: Tof_q <br>
- datasets: dXrY, where X is the TEPX disc ID ((-4)-4) and Y is the TEPX ring ID (1-5) <br>

The hdf5 files together with the standard ROOT simulation outputs are located on lxplus EOS at: <br>
`/eos/cms/store/group/dpg_bril/comm_bril/phase2-sim`

BIB simulation outputs are located at: <br>
`/eos/cms/store/group/dpg_bril/comm_bril/phase2-sim/bib_simulations_fullgeo/hdf5`

The directory `full_stat_simhit` contains the main simulation results with the following number of events: <br>

- beam halo: 500.000 (500.000)
- beam gas carbon: 165.000 (200.000)
- beam gas oxygen: 190.000 (200.000)
- beam gas hydrogen: 185.000 (195.000)

Pileup events are simulated in a similar way and the corresponding hdf5 outputs are located at:
`/eos/cms/store/group/dpg_bril/comm_bril/phase2-sim/pu_simulations_fullgeo/hdf5`

The directory `full_stat_simhit` contains the main simulation results with the following number of events: <br>

- PU 200: 930 (1000)

The number of events launched are indicated in brackets. Simulations are always split into multiple jobs (10 events/job for PU and 5000 events for BIB) and submitted to lxbatch. <br>

For BIB the setting beam 1 was used. This means that the BIB particles come from the +Z side from the interface plane between the LHC long straight section and the CMS cavern, at Z=2260 cm. Shower will be produced on the -Z side due to interactions with the CMS detector material, therefore TEPX discs on the negative side will have a larger number of hits. We are interested in the incoming BIB not the shower, so take disc 4 that is on the +Z side and is reached first by the BIB particles and therefore has negative time of flight values (~(-8.5) ns). For PU samples both disc 4 and -4 have a similar number of hits as the CMS geometry is symmetric. <br>

In the workflow, the CMS ReadOut Chip (CROC) efficiency mask (tornado mask) is overlaid on the time-of-flight charge distribution. The mask was generated by using a timewalk simulation curve with the CROC (RD53B chip) which models the timewalk effect in the chip that tells the delay in the signal detection depending on the charge, given a constant threshold discriminator. In general, low charges with small signals are detected later than higher charges with large signals due to their slower rise as seen on the figure below. Signals that reach the threshold after 25 ns (between the blue and red curves) will be assigned to the next bunch crossing by the readout electronics. <br>

The simulated timewalk curve is shifted and mirrored against the time axis to create the tornado mask, which tells when the hit has to be detected in order to be assigned to the current bunch crossing window.
